## SVGs

```text
I will provide you with images to help bring your ideas to life. I will deliver these gradually for your review and refinement. I am currently developing a front-end application using Vue.js and Nuxt.js for a Car Infotainment System. I would appreciate your assistance in creating an SVG of the car so that I can integrate it into the application at a later stage.
```

```text
I would like two main SVGs: one for the dashboard and one for the car.
```

```text
Let's thoroughly review all the details to ensure we don't overlook anything. Please double-check all the images that I have provided to you from the beginning until now to improve the Car and Dashboard SVGs.
```

```text
Please assist in enhancing the car SVG to make it more visually appealing, imparting a high-tech and modern feel. Ensure that the top-down view is maintained and include as much detail as our current car SVG. Additionally, please review our car SVG to check if any important parts or functionalities have been omitted. Provide me with your plan first.
