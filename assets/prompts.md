## SVGs

```text
I will provide you with images to help bring your ideas to life. I will deliver these gradually for your review and refinement. I am currently developing a front-end application using Vue.js and Nuxt.js for a Car Infotainment System. I would appreciate your assistance in creating an SVG of the car so that I can integrate it into the application at a later stage.

I would like two main SVGs: one for the dashboard and one for the car.

Let's thoroughly review all the details to ensure we don't overlook anything. Please double-check all the images that I have provided to you from the beginning until now to improve the Car and Dashboard SVGs.

Please assist in enhancing the car SVG to make it more visually appealing, imparting a high-tech and modern feel. Ensure that the top-down view is maintained and include as much detail as our current car SVG. Additionally, please review our car SVG to check if any important parts or functionalities have been omitted. Provide me with your plan first.

Please design an SVG of a car in a top-down view to effectively illustrate all the interior, exterior, and features of the car. The design should be attractive, detailed, and visually appealing, with a high-tech, modern feel. To enhance the illustration, incorporate animations and dynamic components. Additionally, include elements that give a 3D-like feel to the design.

rotate the car SVG to a portrait orientation, similar to viewing a phone, while maintaining the top-down view

Please review our car SVG as I would like to improve it further to ensure that no important parts or functionalities have been omitted and that it captures all the details of a real car's interior and exterior. Additionally, consider animating the components to better illustrate their functionality and make them feel like they are in 3D. The design should be attractive, detailed, and visually appealing, with a high-tech, modern feel

Also, can we use variable in our SVG. For example, variable to indicate the door is open/close. If True, animate the door, if not, not animate. For example if  Headlights is flash or not, if True, animate, if not, not animate, ...

Please design an SVG of a car dashboard. The dashboard should display various vehicle information such as speed, fuel level, and temperature. The design should be attractive, detailed, and visually appealing, with a high-tech, modern aesthetic. To enhance the illustration, please incorporate animated and dynamic components. Additionally, include elements that create a 3D-like effect in the design.
