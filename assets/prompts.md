## SVGs

```text
I will provide you with images to help bring your ideas to life. I will deliver these gradually for your review and refinement. I am currently developing a front-end application using Vue.js and Nuxt.js for a Car Infotainment System. I would appreciate your assistance in creating an SVG of the car so that I can integrate it into the application at a later stage.
```

```text
I would like two main SVGs: one for the dashboard and one for the car.
```

```text
Let's thoroughly review all the details to ensure we don't overlook anything. Please double-check all the images that I have provided to you from the beginning until now to improve the Car and Dashboard SVGs.
```

```text
Please help me make the car SVG more attractive, imparting a high-tech, modern feel.
Remember to maintain the top-down view and include as much detail as our current car SVG.
